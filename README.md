I have successfully completed my internship at Logritha Technologies, where I worked on an exciting project integrating Machine Learning with Django and Python. 

Project Overview:

I developed a web application to predict a student's final grades based on their performance in previous assignments and unit tests.

This project was not just a learning experience but also a first step to explore more about applying machine learning to a real-world scenario. 

The application features:

- Login System: User authentication for accessing the application.

- Main Menu: Central hub with options to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

- Preprocessing: Data cleaning and transformation to prepare for model training.

- Training: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to train on the processed data.

- Prediction: Generating predictions for students' final grades using the trained model.

Skills Developed:

* Python & Django: Built a user-friendly interface for the web application.

* Machine Learning: Applied algorithms for data prediction and analysis.

* Full-Stack Development: Learned basic idea in both front-end and back-end development.

Through this internship, I have enhanced my skills in Python, Django, machine learning, and full-stack development, setting a foundation for future projects in these domains. ðŸŽ“ðŸ’»
